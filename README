  Note: Currently requires the PHP server-side framework for CAPTCHA
        generation.


  Overview:

    * Hides published email addresses from conventional web crawlers.

    * Supports organization directories with multiple email addresses.

    * Each unique visitor can privately see the published email addresses only
      by solving a CAPTCHA challenge.

    * Published email addresses are revealed in clickable links compatible
      with the browser-configured default email client.

    * The process of entering the CAPTCHA challenge does not involve page
      navigation or switching browser windows.

    * CAPTCHA re-entry not always necessary on subsequent page re-visits.

    * Works on IE6 and better browsers.
